# Git Onboard

A Python CLI tool that walks beginners through Git step by step — explaining what each command does, why it matters, and running the real commands for you.

## The Problem

Learning Git from scratch is intimidating — the commands are cryptic, the terminology is confusing, and most tutorials assume you already know what you're doing.

## The Solution

A Python CLI tool that walks beginners through Git step by step — explaining what each command does, why it matters, and running the real commands for you.

## How It Works

Runs in the terminal as a single Python script. Walks users through the full Git workflow — from initializing a repo to pushing code to GitHub — with plain-English explanations before every command. Designed to be used repeatedly until the user is comfortable working with Git on their own.

## Results

Reduces the Git learning curve from days of tutorial-hopping to a single guided session. Built-in guardrails catch common beginner mistakes (wrong directory, missing commits, auth failures) before they become frustrating dead ends.
